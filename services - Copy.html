                             KMC is an equal opportunities employer. We do not discriminate on grounds of age, gender, colour, race, ethnicity, language, caste, creed, economic or social status or disability. We value the diversity of the markets in which we operate. Diversity is central to KMC’s brand image and is an integral part of our “managing for growth” and people strategies. We recognize that having a workforce that broadly reflects the composition of the local communities in which we operate places us in a unique position to understand and respond to the needs of our customers. We thus use diversity as a competitive differentiator, both in employment and in customer markets.

                            In keeping with the current strategic needs, KMC advertises the following post.
